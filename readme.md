# Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of computer science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under datasets directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

# Machine Learning


- Micro Projects
    - [Final grade student prediction](ML%20Micro%20Projects/Final_grade_student_prediction.ipynb): Using Linear Regression to predict the final grade of a student.
    - [Car's quality prediction](ML%20Micro%20Projects/Car_quality_prediction.ipynb): Using KNN to predict the category of a car.
    - [Hepatitis patients prediction](ML%20Micro%20Projects/Hepatitis_patients_prediction.ipynb): Using SVM, RF and DT to predict whether the patient with hepatitis is dead or alive.
    - [Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews](ML%20Micro%20Projects/Analyse_sentiment.ipynb): Using Embedding and LSTM to predict if a movie review is positive or negative.

    *Tools: Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Imblearn*
    
# Academic projects


   - [Drive Park](https://github.com/reda-maizate/Drive-Park), is a parking space rental service with an application, we are setting up several premises in the Parisian capital; our premises will be secured with remote monitoring agents which will allow you to leave your car in complete serenity. Access to our car parks will be automated with QRs glued to our customers' windscreens.
   
     *Tools: Python, Arduino and React Native*   

   - [Spirit Rush](https://github.com/reda-maizate/Spirit-Rush). We are in 2177, humanity now has access to the brain implant to improve cognitive performance, man becomes one with the machine. Spirit rush is a virus that will infect the brain implant altering the person's consciousness. His consciousness is locked in a labyrinth of virtual reality that deprives him of access to the real world. The only way to regain consciousness is to overcome the virus by completing all levels. 
   
     *Tools: C# and Unity*
