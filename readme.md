# Academic projects


   - [Drive Park](https://github.com/reda-maizate/Drive-Park), is a parking space rental service with an application, we are setting up several premises in the Parisian capital; our premises will be secured with remote monitoring agents which will allow you to leave your car in complete serenity. Access to our car parks will be automated with QRs glued to our customers' windscreens.

   - [Spirit Rush](https://github.com/reda-maizate/Spirit-Rush). We are in 2177, humanity now has access to the brain implant to improve cognitive performance, man becomes one with the machine. Spirit rush is a virus that will infect the brain implant altering the person's consciousness. His consciousness is locked in a labyrinth of virtual reality that deprives him of access to the real world. The only way to regain consciousness is to overcome the virus by completing all levels.
